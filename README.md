# CLAC-TinyURL
This will be the solution repo for a lab aiming to emulate the functionality of tinyurl

We will take inspiration of features from [this](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview/m2ygV4E81AR#div-stylecolorblack-background-colore2f4c7-border-radius5px-padding5px2-requirements-and-goals-of-the-systemdiv) link

Please create a local_constants.py file for all environment variables specific to your project, including:
``` python
 AWS_PROFILE = '<your_local_profile_name>'
```
